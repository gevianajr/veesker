## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email **security@veesker.cloud** with:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Optional: suggested fix

We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours** and provide a fix timeline within **7 days** for critical issues. We will credit reporters in release notes unless anonymity is requested.

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Architecture

### Credential Storage
Passwords and API keys are stored exclusively in the OS keychain:
- **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager (`veesker:` prefix)
- **macOS**: macOS Keychain (`veesker:` prefix)
- **Linux**: libsecret / GNOME Keyring

Credentials are never written to SQLite, log files, or audit files. They are transmitted only over a localhost stdin/stdout pipe (the Tauri IPC channel) to open Oracle sessions.

### SQL Execution Model
Every SQL statement requires explicit user action (clicking Run or pressing the execute shortcut). Veesker never:
- Executes SQL in the background
- Auto-commits transactions
- Runs scheduled or timed queries

`oracledb.autoCommit` is set to `false` globally and repeated on every execute call. Users must explicitly COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

### AI Boundaries (Sheep assistant)
The AI assistant suggests SQL and explains results — it never executes anything autonomously.

**What Sheep sends to `api.anthropic.com`:**
- Schema names, table names, column names
- SQL you write and submit for analysis
- Query result samples (up to 50 rows by default)
- Oracle database version string

**What Sheep never sends:**
- Passwords or connection strings
- Wallet files or certificate data
- Full table dumps or bulk data exports
- Data from schemas marked as sensitive (Cloud Edition)

An explicit disclosure modal is shown before AI can be used on a connection. The sidecar also enforces a secondary gate — AI calls on production-tagged connections require per-session acknowledgement.

### Audit Trail
Every executed statement is written to `<app_data>/audit/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` by the Rust host process (`src-tauri/src/commands.rs → write_audit_entry()`). This write happens in the native layer — a compromised renderer cannot suppress it. Each entry records: timestamp, connection id, host, username, SQL, success/failure, row count, elapsed time, env tag, and origin (user-typed / AI tool call / system).

Each line is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before write (`src-tauri/src/crypto.rs → encrypt_audit_line()`): 12-byte random nonce, 16-byte AEAD tag, base64-encoded, prefixed `02:`. The decryption key lives in the OS keychain under `veesker:audit-cipher-key` and is never written to disk.

#### Why Audit Preserves Raw SQL

The audit JSONL records the SQL statement exactly as submitted — inside the AES-256-GCM ciphertext — without PII masking.

PII masking (CPF, CNPJ, email, credit card, phone, RG patterns — `src-tauri/src/pii.rs`) is applied to query history (`command_history` table) but deliberately **not** to audit entries. The audit is a forensic record: if a query caused a data breach or a compliance incident, the exact SQL must be reproducible. Masking at write time destroys forensic value.

The raw SQL is protected by encryption at rest — a filesystem-level attacker who reads the audit files gets ciphertext, not plaintext. This is a deliberate design decision, not an oversight.

### Read-Only Mode
When a connection is configured as read-only, the sidecar (`sidecar/src/oracle.ts → enforceSafetyForStatement()`) rejects any non-SELECT statement with error code `-32030` before it reaches Oracle. This guard is enforced server-side and cannot be bypassed by the UI layer.

**DML safety scope:** `enforceSafetyForStatement()` also enforces per-env DML confirmation for `DELETE`/`UPDATE` without `WHERE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `MERGE` (`sidecar/src/oracle.ts:1217–1310`). DDL and DCL statements (`DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `ALTER USER`, `SHUTDOWN`) currently pass through without a confirmation dialog — this is a known gap addressed in the next release (roadmap Phase 1 Item #1A).

### Content Security Policy
The WebView CSP does not allow `eval`, inline scripts, or arbitrary network connections. The `connect-src` directive is limited to the Tauri IPC channel and `api.veesker.cloud`. The Anthropic API is called from the sidecar process, not the WebView.

## Known Limitations (Community Edition)

- **Query history is encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM per row, key in OS keychain, fail-closed via `src-tauri/src/crypto.rs → get_or_create_command_history_key()`). If the keychain is unavailable the history is disabled for the session rather than falling back to plaintext. Legacy rows written before encryption was introduced remain readable for backward compatibility.
- **Audit JSONL is encrypted but has no HMAC chain integrity protection in CE.** A process with local filesystem access can delete or reorder audit entries without detection — the encryption prevents reading them, but not removing them. HMAC chain (SHA-256 linking each entry to the previous) is implemented in Cloud Edition (`cl/src-tauri/src/audit/chain.rs`) and will be ported to CE in the next release (roadmap Phase 1 Item #1D).
- **DDL and DCL statements execute without a confirmation dialog.** `DROP TABLE`, `DROP PACKAGE`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `ALTER USER` are not intercepted by the DML safety modal. This is a known gap — roadmap Phase 1 Item #1A adds a dedicated DDL/DCL confirmation modal with object-name type-to-confirm in PROD environments.
- **AI read-only enforcement is keyword-based**, not parse-based. The SQL tokenizer handles Oracle-specific syntax (q-quoted strings, block comments) but cannot provide formal guarantees against all SQL injection vectors in AI-generated content.
- **Schema browser is incomplete.** Materialized Views, Synonyms, DB Links, Jobs/Scheduler, and Directories are not yet shown in the schema tree. Planned for the next release (roadmap Phase 1 Items #1B and #1C).

## Open Source Auditability

All safety-critical code is in the Apache 2.0 Community Edition repository. You can read, audit, and compile every line that touches your Oracle database.

Key files to review:
- `sidecar/src/oracle.ts` — all Oracle operations, safety guards, auto-commit enforcement, env-calibrated DML tiers
- `sidecar/src/sql-kind.ts` — SQL classification and unsafe DML detection (`classifySql`, `isUnsafeBulkDml`)
- `sidecar/src/ai.ts` — AI integration, what data is sent, PROD gate (`enforcePsdpmForOrigin`)
- `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` — audit logging (`write_audit_entry`), credential handling, SSRF protections
- `src-tauri/src/crypto.rs` — AES-256-GCM encryption for audit JSONL and command history
- `src-tauri/src/pii.rs` — PII masking patterns applied to command history

| Phase | Item | What ships |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Item #1A | DDL/DCL confirmation modal — `DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, `ALTER USER` require explicit confirmation; PROD requires typing the object name |
| Phase 1 | Item #1D | HMAC chain CE port — HMAC-SHA256 per audit entry, linking to previous; tampering and deletion become detectable; UI badge "Chain intact ✓ / broken at date X" |
